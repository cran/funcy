/**
 * A Transaction is an agreed-upon communication event, which you may
 * think of as a "state machine".
 *
 * Synchronous message passing systems consider sending one message at
 * a time along with a tag.  For asynchronous message passing, a single
 * "transaction" might be a lot more complicated than just sending or
 * receiving a single message.  However, many of these transactions may be
 * in flight at the same time, and it becomes necessary to keep track of
 * each transaction separately because each one has different internal
 * state.  Instead of a tag, a "channel" is an agreed-upon number used
 * to start up new transactions, after which a dynamically-assigned
 * transaction number is used for the remainder of the transaction.
 *
 * To use Transactions, either use a BasicTransaction (which mimics
 * traditional synchronous message passing) or inherit from this class
 * and implement HandleMessage.  If you implement your own, you should
 * store any internal state in the class itself.  Keep in mind that
 * transactions are used from two contexts: one is created on the requesting
 * side by client code, and one is created on the Channel side
 * asynchronously.  The RPC system makes no assumptions about how you
 * manage your memory, so a transaction that is allocated on the
 * heap needs to know when to delete itself.
 *
 * A Transaction becomes registered with a transaction number on each
 * machine it is involved with.  Both machines keep track of vacant
 * transaction numbers and will recycle them, so unregistering a transaction
 * properly is very important.  The Done() functions are responsible for
 * freeing up a transaction number for recycling, and both sides must
 * make sure to agree upon it.
 *
 * Of all the difficulties in programming asynchronously, we make a major
 * guarantee: HandleMessage is only called from the network thread and
 * thus is only called once at a time.  Therefore, when calling all of
 * the functions within Transaction, if you are calling from within
 * the context of HandleMessage, you don't have to worry about another
 * response being received quickly.
 *
 * When calling from another thread, beware of receiving a response from the
 * other machine faster than you'd expect.
